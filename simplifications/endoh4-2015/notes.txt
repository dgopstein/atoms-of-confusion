0001: Google format
0002: Add return types to function declarations - C99-6.7.2
0003: Add explicit return value - C99-6.9.1p12
0004: Declare and use printf instead of putchar (so the user only needs to know printf, not putchar as well)
0005: Add excplicit types to function signatures - C99-6.7.5.3
0006: Add second parameter to main() - C99-5.1.2.2p1
0007: Standardize all variable names
0008: Even out operator spacing
0010: Removed assignment used as value
0020: Replace ternary with if. Involved duplicating the code and moving other initialization code before the first copy.
0030: Replace ternary with if
0031: Remove assignment used as value I introduced in the last step
0040: Replace ternary with if
0050: Replace comma operator with semicolons
0060: Replace ternary with if
0070: Logic as control flow
0080: Replace ternary with if, using whole expression inside branch instead of variable assignment
0090: Added explicit logical test to conditions
0100: Remove assignment used as val

c001: add printf statements
c002: use %d so users don't need to know ascii codes
c003: hardcode small constants so execution time is shorter

TODO:
- Run clang-format on both C and NC versions
