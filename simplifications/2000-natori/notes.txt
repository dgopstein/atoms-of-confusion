0001: Added type information to main's signature and casted the variables where necessary
0002: Ran clang-format
0003: Removed obscure functions
0004: Simplify constants to head-computable values
0005: Standardize variable names
0010: Ternary to if
0020: Comma to semicolon
0030: Comma to semicolon
0040: Swap subscripts
0050: Add parens
0060: Make int truncation explicit
0070: Comma to semicolon
0080: Logic as control flow
0090: Replace pre-increment with a temp variable
0100: Make comparisons against zero explicit
0110: Make int truncation explicit
0120: Add parens
0130: Remove pre-increment

c020: Add intermediate function, F1(int, int, int) so that the type of V2 isn't char** and ++ has definite symantics (increase by 1 instead of 8). Also change constants to iterate fewer times and produce more faried output. Add another printf for more insight.
c030: Remove main args
c040: Clang format again
c050: Add halt message to know if people give up
