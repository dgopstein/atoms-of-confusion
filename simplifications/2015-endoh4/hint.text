## Judges' comments:
### To use:

    make

    ./prog <a number of arguments>

### Try:

    ./prog @ @ @ @ @ @

    ./prog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

    ./prog $(perl -e 'print "@ " x (2*3*5*7);')

    ./prog $(< Makefile)

### Selected Judges Remarks:

For this one liner it is best to avoid prime numbers. The output groups
factors in the x-y dimensions. How many factors can be represented before you
run out of command line argument space? How could you modify the program to
experiment with numbers that have more or larger factors?


## Author's comments:
Visual factorization 1-liner.  Try:

    gcc -o prog prog.c
    ./prog @
    ./prog @ @
    ./prog @ @ @
    ./prog @ @ @ @
    ./prog @ @ @ @ @ @
    ./prog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
    ./prog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

EDIT: `prog.orig.c` is the original version that I submitted.  Gil Dogon kindly improved it during the review.  Thank you!
